# Raspberry Pi HomeLab

Welcome to my personal homelab project!<br/>
This repository contains the configuration files, automation scripts, and deployment instructions for managing my Raspberry Pi-based homelab environment.

### Key Features:
* Local-Only Services ‚Äì All services are accessible only within the local network.
* Secure Access ‚Äì Services are secured with HTTPS using DuckDNS for dynamic DNS.
* Temperature Control ‚Äì The Raspberry Pi is equipped with an automatic fan controlled by a custom GPIO script to manage CPU/GPU temperatures.

- **RAM**: 8GB

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Operating System
- **OS**: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)  

---

### üß∞ Applications
A collection of essential services running in Docker containers, all orchestrated via `docker-compose`.

- **Homepage** ‚Äì Central dashboard for accessing all homelab services.
- **Plex** ‚Äì Media server to stream movies, TV shows, and music.
- **Prowlarr** ‚Äì Torrent indexer manager.
- **Sonarr** ‚Äì TV series downloader and organizer.
- **Radarr** ‚Äì Automated movie downloader and manager.
- **Transmission** ‚Äì Lightweight torrent client for downloading files.
- **Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)** ‚Äì Simple web interface for managing Nginx proxy hosts.
- **Pi-hole** ‚Äì Network-wide ad blocker and tracker blocker.

### üîß Scripts
#### **fan_control.py**  
Used to manage CPU & GPU temperatures by controlling a 5V fan through GPIO.  

- **Setup**:
  - The fan connects to an NPN 2N2222A transistor, enabling automatic on/off control via GPIO.
  - Example circuit diagram:  
    ![Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfefdb75-9d30-48e5-855b-3c200305644f)
- **Setup script to run automatically**
  1. Change `/path/to/` in `fan_control.sh` to match path of `fan_control.py`
  2. Put script in `/etc/init.d`
  3. You can start automatic script with command `/etc/init.d/fan_control start`<br/>
  NOTE: Check RPI temperature with command `vcgencmd measure_temp`
  
- **Behavior**:
  - Fan activates at **65¬∞C** and deactivates at **40¬∞C** to maintain optimal temperature.

### üöÄ How to Start the Project

The setup uses Docker Compose and environment variables to manage services.<br/>
Plex and other apps require initial configuration via their UIs after deployment.

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. Ensure `.env` contains all necessary environment variables. Example provided in `.env.sample` file.

```
IP: RPI server‚Äôs IP address.
HOMEPAGE_HOST: List of hosts for Homepage.
PLEX_CLAIM: Plex account claim key for linking the server.
SSD1_DRIVE: Additional drive path which is connected  to RPI.
SSD1_PATH: Path to your media storage (inside you have to have two dirs for movies & TV shows).
TRANSMISSION_USERNAME: Username for the Transmission torrent client.
TRANSMISSION_PASSWORD: Password for the Transmission torrent client.
PLEX_IP: Internal IP address of the Plex server.
PLEX_URL: URL to access the Plex UI.
PROWLARR_IP: Internal IP address of the Prowlarr server.
PROWLARR_URL: URL to access the Prowlarr server (torrent indexer) UI.
RADARR_IP: Internal IP address of the Radarr server.
RADARR_URL: URL to access the Radarr server (movie manager) UI.
SONARR_IP: Internal IP address of the Sonarr server.
SONARR_URL: URL to access the Sonarr server (TV show manager) UI.
TRANSMISSION_IP: Internal IP address of the Transmission client.
TRANSMISSION_URL: URL to access the Transmission client.
NPM_IP: Internal IP address of Nginx Proxy Manager.
NPM_URL: URL to access Nginx Proxy Manager UI.
NPM_USERNAME: Username to log in to Nginx Proxy Manager.
NPM_PASSWORD: Password to log in to Nginx Proxy Manager.
PIHOLE_IP: Internal IP address of the Pi-hole server (ad blocker/DNS).
PIHOLE_URL: URL to access the Pi-hole UI.
PIHOLE_KEY: API key for the Pi-hole server to manage DNS and ad-blocking settings.
PLEX_KEY: Authentication key for Plex server.
PROWLARR_KEY: Authentication key for Prowlarr.
RADARR_KEY: Authentication key for Radarr.
SONARR_KEY: Authentication key for Sonarr.
```
3. Then, run the following command to launch all services (set `.env` file path accordingly):

```bash
docker-compose --env-file ~/homelab/.env up -d
```

4. You will have to additionally configure all settings of services via UI.
   
5. Configure Pi-hole and Router

**Router Model:** Asus RT-AX58U  
**Firmware Version:** 3.0.0.4.388_25210

### Step 5.1: Set a Static IP for Raspberry Pi

Go to your router‚Äôs **LAN ‚Üí DHCP Server** settings and assign a static IP to your Raspberry Pi.

---

### Step 5.2: Set Pi-hole as Your DNS Server

Under **WAN ‚Üí Internet Connection**, set the DNS Server fields to the Pi-hole‚Äôs static IP address.

---

### Step 5.3: (Optional) Allow All Origins in Pi-hole

If get DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_BAD_CONFIG error, go to **Pi-hole Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí DNS**, and enable "Permit all origins" to allow DNS requests from different devices.
